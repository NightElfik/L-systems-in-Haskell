L-systems in Haskell
====================

Relatively advanced L-system library written in Haskell.
Out of the box it supports symbols with parameters, conditional rewriting, and it can evaluate expressions with binary and unary operators.
There are two available L-system interpreters: text and SVG vector graphics.
The code is well commented and written with extensibility in mind.
It is easy to add new operators, new interpreters, or even extend the grammar.
This project was my final program of Non-procedural programming class.
